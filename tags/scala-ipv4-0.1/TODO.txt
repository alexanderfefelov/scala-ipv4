- verify pool performance -> stackoverflow in redblack ?
- implement Range or whatever to be able to loop through ip address ranges etc
- apply/unapply for networks, ranges and pools
- enhance BDD examples (the DSL allows for finer syntax than what I'm currently doing)
- be inspired by some of the functionality in http://www.rhythm.cx/~steve/devel/iptree/
- switch to scala 2.8
- add java interfaces?
- make available (maven repo)
