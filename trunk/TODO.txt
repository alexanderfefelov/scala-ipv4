- move to github (or maybe not)
- add mac address pool, and abstract the pool concept from ip address pool, and make sure they are thread safe!
- verify pool performance
- implement iterable or whatever to be able to loop through ip address ranges etc
- check TODO's in code (constructor versus factory methods -> all constructors? or different apply/unapply combinations?, ...)
- apply/unapply
- examples as BDD test?
- change package name
- rename the project
- javadoc (@author tags etc)
- do I need to use case classes?
- blog it
