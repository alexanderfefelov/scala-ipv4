- verify pool performance
- implement iterable or whatever to be able to loop through ip address ranges etc
- check TODO's in code (constructor versus factory methods -> all constructors? or different apply/unapply combinations?, ...)
- apply/unapply
- enhance BDD examples (the DSL allows for finer syntax than what I'm currently doing)
- change package name iptypes
- rename the project iptypes
- javadoc (@author tags etc)
- be inspired by some of the functionality in http://www.rhythm.cx/~steve/devel/iptree/
